# Headscroll Client

This is the front-end portion of the Headscroll project, a full-stack social media web app loosely based on Facebook. (Face Book, Head Scroll, eh eh?)

## Installation

Clone the project and then use the package manager yarn to install and run Resume Generator.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Jakedalus/headscroll-client.git
cd headscroll-client
npm install
npm start
```

Headscroll's backend uses MongoDB as its database; I recommend using Mongo Atlas. Otherwise you will have to setup a mongo instance on your local machine. 

The project, both front and back ends, are hosted on Heroku: you'll have to set 'DB_URI' in the environment variables on your own copy.
